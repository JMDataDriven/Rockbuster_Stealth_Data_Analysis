# Rockbuster_Stealth_Data_Analysis
## Project Overview

### Background: 
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that had stores worldwide. However, with the rise of competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster management team has made a pivotal change to adapt to the industry by using the existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service. 
### Objective: 
The Rockbuster Stealth management board has asked a series of business questions in expectation of data-driven insights that can be utilized for their 2020 company strategy.

### Key Questions:
1. Which movies contributed the most / least to revenue gain?
2. What was the average rental duration for all videos?
3. Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
4. Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
5. Do sales figures vary between geographic locations?

## Data & Tools:
Rockbuster's data set includes information on film inventory, customers, payments, rental durations, stores, staff, and addresses. 
In order to answer the key business questions, queried the data through Postgre SQL in DbVisualizer for analysis. Created visualizations on findings as a tableau storyboard.
